                                            Rules
                        ###############################################


1. The Game is played between two Players who start with a deck of 26 cards each.
2. In each turn(called a battle) each player removes the top card from the deck and compare the cards.
   Whichever player has the card of higher value wins that battle(Aces are high, and suits are ignored).This continues until one player has all the 52 cards.
3. In case both players have the card of same value we go into a war.
4. In a war, each player places 3 cards face down on the table. Then they remove another card, face up
   from the pile, this continues until the tie is broken. Whoever wins the this war wins all the cards
   on the table.
5. If a war has not outcome, we go into another war. This continues until someone wins or runs out of
   cards.
6. If someone does not have have enough cards to participate in the battle, they instantly lose and the
   opponent is declared the win.

                    #########################################################


1. This Game has only 2 players.
2. Wikipedia states the following:
   "Most descriptions of War are unclear about what happens if a player runs out of cards during a war.[2] In some variants, that player immediately loses."
   We will be following this rule.
   This Game assumes that if you want to participate in a War you need to have the minimum number of
   cards, which is 4. (this is in addition to tiebreaker card already on the table)

1. Since this is a probabalistic game, there is a mathematical chance that the two decks are shuffled in
   a way where we might get stuck in a loop where the number of cards that each deck has starts
   oscillating towards the centre (26-26) instead of one deck becoming zero. For this purpose, when automating the game, if there is no winner after 10000 turns we end the game with no result.
